# Sephora_perfume

Sephora perfume project (Python)


We chose this dataset because we love beauty products. We come from different sides of the world and are 
interested in different types of makeup and bauty, but studing in the United States brought us together 
and we chose to do a data analyis on one of the biggest beauty stores in the United States: Sephora. Not
only does this store sell makeup, but a large variety of things such as perfume, cologne, face moisturizers,
beauty/makeup tools, hair care and many more. We will analyze the dataset and provide results regarding the
largest category: perfume.
